## OpenWrt介绍

# TEST 测试 markdown style

# Getting Started

Milkdown is a lightweight but powerful WYSIWYG markdown editor. It consists of two parts:

- A tiny core which provides a plugin loader and all kinds of internal plugins.
- Lots of additional plugins provide syntax, commands and components.

With this pattern you can enable or disable any custom syntax and feature you like, such as table, latex and tooltip. You can also create your own plugin to support your awesome idea.

> 🍼 Fun fact: The Milkdown documentation is rendered by milkdown.

## First editor

Here are some examples to help you get started with creating your first editor:

```typescript
import { Editor } from '@milkdown/core';
import { commonmark } from '@milkdown/preset-commonmark';

import { nord } from '@milkdown/theme-nord';
import '@milkdown/theme-nord/style.css';

Editor
  .make()
  .config(nord)
  .use(commonmark)
  .create();
```

## Taste the plugin

Now let's add **undo & redo** support to our editor using the `history` plugin:

```typescript
import { Editor } from '@milkdown/core';
import { commonmark } from '@milkdown/preset-commonmark';
import { history } from '@milkdown/plugin-history';

import { nord } from '@milkdown/theme-nord';
import '@milkdown/theme-nord/style.css';

Editor
  .make()
  .config(nord)
  .use(commonmark)
  .use(history)
  .create();
```

> `<Mod>` is `<Cmd>` for mac and `<Ctrl>` for other platforms.

Now we can undo an edit by using `<Mod-z>` and redo it by using `<Mod-y>/<Shift-Mod-Z>`.
